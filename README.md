# WomenInTech
## Project submitted and selected in the Swift Student Challenge 2022 ðŸŽ‰.

When we think about great names that made a great impact in the world, we often think first about men. However, many women have also made important changes that contributed for the development of the world. So why do we rarely see those women being mentioned? The technology area is what it is today because of many great women, so let's learn more about some of them.  

**On this project you will see a timeline. Use the slider at the bottom to go through the years. If you want to see more information about each woman, just tap on them.**

**For a better experience, please use an iPad simulator on Landscape mode.**

Many more women have and still are contributing to improve the world through technology. I hope that we can acknowledge those womenâ€™s work and their importance, not only because of how they impact the world in general, but also because of how they could impact girls that want to grow up and make changes themselves.
